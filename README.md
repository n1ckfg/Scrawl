# Scrawl

Scrawl is a standalone RGBA shape generator/positioner with painting capabilities, full MIDI/keyboard and some mouse control for the Raspberry Pi (currently using 3b+).

This project was originally meant as a means to an end for my community theatre. DMX lighting can get very expensive when you are talking about moving heads and RGB color mixing(or any other colorspace). I wanted to try to make a project where I could replicate this behavior with a Raspberry Pi and a projector. There would be obvious limitations but it could also do things even the most expensive DMX light could not, at least in my head it would.

I started watching some openframeworks tutorial videos https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4neAtv21WOlqpDzGqbGM_WN2hc5ZaVv7

then I started playing with R_E_C_U_R https://github.com/langolierz/r_e_c_u_r

and then finally waaaave pool was released https://github.com/ex-zee-ex/waaaave_pool

waaaaave pool released a distribution that has become the foundation for Scrawl. Through much trial and error I figured out my way around the raspberry pi and loaded up some simple projects.

while the project was born for theatre it will be perfectly at home in a video synthesis environment where I will also use it.

I'm totally new to github so bear with me as I learn how to best keep things updated my intention is to release this project as source files and also a downloadable disk image to be burned onto a microSD card with something like https://www.balena.io/etcher/

if you have suggestions feel free to send them to me

currently the next steps are
1. refine MIDI control
2. make things generally more readable and understandable
3. clean up the simple brushes
4. add 1 more specific kind of brush
5. write instructions for how I got the whole thing working
6. learn how / upload it all on github

in the future I'll add
more advanced brushes
the ability to auto modulate some parameters
built in mirroring of the brushes (this is a blast to play with)
possibly the ability to use the brush size/position as a frame for video playback/webcam/picture input


got the auto boot working 
so when I've got all my fixes together I'll supply 

a) the source on here

as well as 

b) an img to flash onto a microSD card if you would rather 
(haven't tried the image creation part yet but it looks pretty easy)

here are a couple pictures of it in various uses
