# Scrawl
standalone Raspberry Pi shape generator/positioner/painter

Scrawl is a standalone RGBA shape generator/positioner with painting capabilities, full MIDI/keyboard and some mouse control for the Raspberry Pi (currently using 3b+).

This project was originally meant as a means to an end for my community theatre. DMX lighting can get very expensive when you are talking about moving heads and RGB color mixing(or any other colorspace). I wanted to try to make a project where I could replicate this behavior with a Raspberry Pi and a projector. There would be obvious limitations but it could also do things even the most expensive DMX light could not, at least in my head it would.

I started watching some openframeworks tutorial videos https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4neAtv21WOlqpDzGqbGM_WN2hc5ZaVv7

then I started playing with R_E_C_U_R https://github.com/langolierz/r_e_c_u_r

and then finally waaaaave pool was released https://github.com/ex-zee-ex/waaaave_pool

waaaaave pool released a distribution that has become the foundation for Scrawl. Through much trial and error I figured out my way around the raspberry pi and loaded up some simple projects.

while the project was born for theatre it will be perfectly at home in a video synthesis environment where I will also use it.

I'm totally new to github so bear with me as I learn how to best keep things updated my intention is to release this project as source files and also a downloadable disk image to be burned onto a microSD card with something like https://www.balena.io/etcher/

if you have suggestions feel free to send them to me

here are a couple pictures of it in various uses
